i added the new learnings that I have learned upon finishing the 'Cascade' lesson under the CSS section of the TOP.

This highlights the changes I made wherein:
- Add styles to the plain HTML
- Sample of class selectors, grouping selectors, and specifity(?)
- Add colors, and font type, style, weight, etc
- Fix: Text alignment
- Overall, just made it visually bearable for now based on what I have learned so far.
