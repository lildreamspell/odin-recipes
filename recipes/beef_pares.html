        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The word <em>pares</em> means <em>pair</em> or <em>pairing</em> in English. 
            This term was coined because the beef stew is always served with rice and soup as part of an all-in-one, 
            low-cost meal set sold in local roadside eateries. <strong>Beef Pares</strong> is a popular dish for motorists looking for a hot, 
            filling meal after a long day on the road.</p>
        <p> This dish is also available at <em>carinderias</em> or <em>pares houses</em> near local establishments 
            such as schools, hospitals, and factories. <em>It is so well-loved and popular that even 
                some high-end restaurants have included this dish on their menus.</em></p>

        <h3>Steps in making Beef Pares</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blanch the beef for about 8 to 10 minutes to keep the broth clear and sediment-free. Change the water, rinse the meat well, and simmer with aromatics until tender.</li>
            <li>When beef is tender, drain from the liquid and braise in a soy sauce, brown sugar, and star anise mixture reminiscent of Chinese Asado.</li>
            <li>Reserve the broth and keep warm on low heat. If you want to remove more of the sediments, you can strain the broth using a cheesecloth or fine-mesh sieve. Garnish with chopped scallions when ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Make sinangag. For best results, use cold, day-old cooked rice.</li>
