        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very tasty and easy-to-make 
            <em>Filipino chicken dish</em> made with <em>soy sauce</em>, <em>garlic</em>, and <em>vinegar</em>.

        <h3>Steps in making Grilled Chicken Adobo</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, mix soy sauce, water, vinegar, honey, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, and place the chicken into the pot. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken, drain on paper towels, and set aside. Discard bay leaves. Return the mixture to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups.</li>
            <li>Place chicken on the prepared grill, about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and crisp. Serve with the remaining soy sauce mixture.</li>
