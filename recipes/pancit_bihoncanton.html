        <h3>Steps in making Pancit Canton with Bihon</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak bihon in a bowl of warm water until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large wok over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, salt, and pepper. 
                Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. 
                Add shrimp; cook until they start to turn color, about 1 minute. 
                Add soy sauce; toss in cabbage, celery, and carrot. 
                Cook until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups water; bring to a boil. 
                Cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken, shrimp, and vegetables to a bowl, leaving the liquid behind in the wok. 
                Add bihon and canton noodles to the liquid. Mix well and cover. 
                Let sit until tender, about 5 minutes. Return 1/2 the chicken-vegetable mixture to the wok; mix with the noodles. 
                Pour soup into bowls; garnish with the remaining chicken-vegetable mixture.</li>
        </ol>
